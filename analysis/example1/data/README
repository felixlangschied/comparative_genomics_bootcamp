This directory should contain data that is generated 
by and/or used by the analysis performed in "example1".

If the analysis "example1" uses a lot of disc-space or generates many files, 
it should contain symbolic links to the data instead.

Data generated during exploration must have 
relevant metadata (variables, cutoffs etc.) in the filename

Data generated by the analysis in "example1" that is ready to be shared
with others should be copied to "shared_data". Data in "shared_data"
must have a meaningful name and a corresponding metadata file.
